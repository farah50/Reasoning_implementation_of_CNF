<h1>  Knowledge Base Resolution in First-Order Logic </h1>

In this project, we focus on converting and resolving logical statements to identify contradictions within a knowledge base (KB). 

<h2> Features </h2>
- Implications Elimination 
- Moving negations 
- Variable Standardization
- moving the quantifier to the left
- Existential & Universal Elimination
- Apply distribution
- Goal negotiation
- Consistency Check

<h3> Note </h3>
This program may not work well with every knowledge base (KB). The effectiveness and correctness of the transformations depend on the specific structure and content of the KB.
