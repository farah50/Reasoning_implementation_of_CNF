<h1>  Knowledge Base Resolution in First-Order Logic </h1>

In this project, we focus on converting and resolving logical statements to identify contradictions within a knowledge base (KB). We use operations like:
eliminating implications, 
moving negations, 
standardizing variables.
moving the quantifier to the left,
eliminate existential & universal,
Apply distribution,
goal negotiation
